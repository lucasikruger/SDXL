## Why?

This repository offers an out-of-the-box web UI for using stable diffusion. It's designed to be easy to install, allowing you to quickly get started with stable diffusion.

### Take into Account

This repository uses NVIDIA Docker, enabling the use of GPUs when necessary. GPU usage depends on the arguments you use in the Docker compose.

#### IMPORTANT: The Model Weights
The model uses **two** sets of weights: one for the base and another for the refiner.
